First code:
This code requests the user to enter a number and assigns its value to the variable x. Then it checks the condition: if x is greater than 10, the value of x is divided by 5, and then it is printed. If the condition is not met, the program simply prints the value of x without any changes.

Second code:This code requests the user to enter two numbers a and b. Then it checks the condition: if b is equal to 0, it prints the message "Oops, cannot do that". Otherwise, the value of a is divided by b, and the result is printed.

Third code:
This code imports the math module, requests the user to enter a number x, and then checks the condition: if x is less than 0, it prints "Cannot be done". Otherwise, it calculates the square root of x using the math.sqrt() function and prints the result.

Fourth code:
This code requests the user to enter a number x. Then it checks the condition: if x is an even number (i.e., the remainder of division by 2 is 0), it multiplies x by itself (x * x) and prints the result. Otherwise, it divides the value of x by 3 and prints the result.

Fifth code:
This code requests the user to enter a number x. Then the program compares the value of x with different numbers (1, 2, 3, and 4) and depending on the value of x, it prints the corresponding season ("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", or "Autumn"). If the value of x does not match any of these numbers, it prints "Does not exist".

Sixth code:
This code requests the user to enter two numbers a and b. Then the program compares their values and prints the corresponding message: "A is greater than B", "B is greater than A", or "A = B".

Seventh code:
This code requests the user to enter two numbers a and b, and also an operator sign (+, -, *, /, or **). Then the program performs the corresponding operation on the numbers and prints the result. If the denominator b is 0 in the case of division, it prints "cannot divide by zero". If the entered operator sign does not match any of the valid operations, it prints "Developers didn't add this".

Eighth code:
This code requests the user to enter one digit. Then the program compares the entered value with different numbers (from 0 to 9) and prints the corresponding word in English for each digit. If the entered value is not a digit from 0 to 9, it prints "Incorrect input!"

Ninth code:
This code requests the user to enter a number. Then the program extracts the last digit of the number, compares it with different numbers from 0 to 9, and prints the corresponding word in Ukrainian for each digit. If the entered value is not a number or its length is not equal to 3, it prints "Incorrect input!".

Tenth code:
This code requests the user to enter a three-digit number. It then checks if the length of the input is not equal to 3 or if the input contains any non-digit characters. If either condition is true, it prints "Incorrect input!". Otherwise, it proceeds to perform the following operations:

Extracts the first digit x, the second digit c, and the third digit v from the input number.
Compares the values of the first and third digits (x and v). If x is greater than v, it multiplies the entire number by 3 and prints the result.
If x is less than v, it rearranges the digits to form a new number by concatenating v, c, and x. Then it prints the result.
If x is equal to v, it multiplies the entire number by the second digit c and prints the result.
